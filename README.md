# Getting Started with Sonus

This app is as simple as it gets when it comes to a tune-by-ear online guitar tuner. Tapping on the strings will play the sound of the tapped/clicked string.

## Available Tunings

Within the tuning nav menu, you can find:

### `Standard Tuning`

This consists of the notes: Low E, A, D, G, B, High E

### `Drop D Tuning`

This consists of the notes: Low D, A, D, G, B, High E

### `Drop C Tuning`

This consists of the notes: Low C, G, C, F, A, High D

### `DADGAD Tuning`

This consists of the notes: Low D, Low A, D, G, A, High D

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Looping

You can loop any of the sounds in order to keep a sound playing as you fine tune your guitar to the tone by ear.

In order to begin, first tap/click on the Loop button and this will stop any sounds that were currently playing. Once the Loop is ON, you can tap/click on a string once and the looping sequence will begin. The sound will replay once it reaches the end.

Tapping/Clicking on another string while another is already looping, will stop that looping sound immdiately and begin to play the new string that was tapped/clicked.

Turning OFF the Loop will again stop all sounds immediately. You can then proceed to tap/click on the strings afterwards to make sounds again.

## *Caution*
Tapping/Clicking on a string multiple times while the Loop is ON will result in all of those taps getting looped.
